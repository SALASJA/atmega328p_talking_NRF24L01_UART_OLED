# atmega328p_talking_NRF24L01_UART_OLED
I have made nanos talking with eachother using NRF24L01. I used a couple of repositories,  the complete code is here so you dont have go to looking for them, but I forgot their original author names,  so kudos to them for helping out. The code is written in pure C and were compiled and   uploaded on my mac using the Crosspack avr tool set, I have a tutorial on how program the  arduino/atmega328p/attiny85 in pure C/C++ on my LinkedIn article at: https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/introduction-avr-c-programming-macos-finally-attiny85-jorge-salas  The article was written in July 2019 by me and the process is EASY, even those who are doing arduino for the first time can be expose to AVR C instead.   The code also features OLED display support in pure C and  UART in pure C (use the 'screen' command in terminal to   access the serial output, you can exit with ctrl+a+d, use 'ls /dev/tty.*' to try to find it will have similar name to the port appearing in Arduino IDE but with tty instead.
